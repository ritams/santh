            <!-- Quantum Classical Correspondence -->
            <section class="research-section" id="quantum-chaos">
                <h2>Quantum Classical Correspondence</h2>
                <p>Classically chaotic systems display sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Many physical systems
                    such as the driven and damped pendulum, atoms in strong magnetic fields, nonlinearly coupled
                    oscillators and periodically driven rotors exhibit this property. Chaos, of course, pervades
                    anything from weather to perhaps even stock market dynamics.</p>
                <p>The quantum dynamics of such systems do not display dependence on initial conditions. One recurring
                    theme of my research is to explore and understand the manifestations of classical chaos in the
                    quantum dynamics. In particular, interest is focussed on how the rich variety in classical dynamical
                    structures affect the quantum spectra. Recently, we had studied <em>quantum-classical
                        correspondence</em> in a non-KAM system.</p>

            <!-- Localisation -->
            <section class="research-section" id="localisation">
                <h2>Chaos, Quantum Localisation and Interactions</h2>
                <p>The interplay between chaotic dynamics, localisation and interactions is of special interest
                    especially in the context of driven quantum systems. Kicked rotor, a pendulum periodically kicked by
                    an external potential, is a prominent and well studied chaotic system. We study different variants
                    of kicked rotor that throw light on the connections between the quantum dynamical localization, a
                    variant of the Anderson localization, and classical (sub-)diffusion. We recently wrote a detailed
                    review article on <em>Quantum kicked rotor and its variants: Chaos, localization and beyond</em> in
                    Physics Reports (2022).</p>
                <p>In a recent work that combines theory, numerics and cold atoms experiment, we have shown how specific
                    manipulation of kick sequence imparted to a rotor can lead to <em>control of quantum
                        decoherence</em>, which shows up as a decay of localization.</p>
                <p>In general, the role of interactions and how they affect localization properties in chaotic and
                    many-body systems is explored. The physical systems of interest range from coupled kicked rotors and
                    kicked tops to quantum spin-chains.</p>

            <!-- Random Matrices -->
            <section class="research-section" id="random-matrices">
                <h2>Random Matrix Spectra</h2>
                <p>Random matrix theory (RMT) is widely used in physics (in condensed matter physics, nuclear physics
                    etc.) to understand the spectral signatures of complex quantum systems and as a qualitative
                    indicator of underlying classical dynamics. RMT is extensively applied in the study of chaotic
                    quantum systems. Recently, we had obtained a <em>series of results</em> for the higher order spacing
                    ratio distributions in random matrix theory and complex quantum systems.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Quantum ML -->
            <section class="research-section" id="quantum-ml">
                <h2>Quantum Computing and Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>Quantum computer is expected to speed-up certain class of problems, the prime factorisation being one
                    such example. One of the central resource for a quantum computer is the quantum entanglement. Our
                    research is focussed on studying entanglement (and more generally quantum correlational properties,
                    and curiously, to understand how it is affected by classical dynamics in the case of chaotic and
                    many-body systems.</p>
                <p>Another exciting area of interest we are starting on is the quantum machine learning (QML). Many
                    machine learning tasks can possibly benefit from their quantised versions. With the advent of real
                    quantum computers, we might actually be able to implement QML algorithms in some years. This has
                    both fundamental and practical benefits.</p>

            <!-- Complex Networks -->
            <section class="research-section" id="networks">
                <h2>Complex Networks</h2>
                <p>Has emerged as a unified framework to study many complex systems, ranging from stock markets to
                    biological processes. We are mainly interested in the dynamical processes on networks, their
                    properties and the interplay between network structure and dynamics on networks. The dynamical
                    processes that we study can range from random walks to coupled chaotic systems. These are relevant
                    for many transport processes on networks and also for such applications as web search engines and
                    online recommender systems.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Extreme Events -->
            <section class="research-section" id="extreme-events">
                <h2>Extreme Events</h2>
                <p>Extreme events are an interesting emergent phenomena in complex systems. Floods, droughts, traffic
                    jams, mobile congestion are some of the commonly encountered extreme events. Unlike floods and
                    droughts, the latter two are examples of extreme events taking place on networks. The aim is to not
                    only understand the properties of extreme events on networks but also explore the possibility of
                    controlling them.</p>
                <p>Our research in the context of random walks on networks has showed a rather counter-intuitive
                    property that extreme events are more likely to take place on small degree nodes of a network than
                    on hubs.</p>

            <!-- Complex Systems -->
            <section class="research-section" id="complex-systems">
                <h2>Complex Systems / Data Science</h2>
                <p>Since the last few decades, principles of physics are beginning to be applied to areas outside of it.
                    Econophysics is one such area that represents an application of principles of physics, especially
                    statistical physics, to some problems of financial markets. Here, our efforts are directed towards
                    understanding larger organising principles of complex systems. One of our recent works was to study
                    <em>record statistics of financial data</em> in the context of geometric random walks.
                </p>
                <p>Since the pandemic began in 2020, we used extensive mobility data in India to create an
                    <em>infectious diseases hazard map</em>.
